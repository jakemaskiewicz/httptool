# HTTP Tool

HTTP Tool is a Mac application that makes HTTP requests for testing RESTful APIs without having to muck around with curl on the command line.

# Description

HTTP Tool is build using the [RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit) framework in order to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests easily. You can specify a base URL, http or https, set whether or not you want to follow redirects, ignore or respect certificates, and apply parameters to the request.
